        <h2>What is Art?</h2>
        <h5>
          The creation of something that expresses ideas, emotions, or beauty,
          or to a skill or ability.
        </h5>
        <h2>The creation of something</h2>
        <h5>
          Art can be the act of creating something to evoke a worthwhile
          experience, often through the expression of beauty, emotional power,
          or technical proficiency. Art can include paintings, drawings,
          sculptures, music, theater, and literature. e.t.c
        </h5>
        <h2>what is Drawing?</h2>
        <h5>
          A drawing is a sketch or a picture, usually made with a pencil or pen.
          You might use extra class time after you've finished a test to make a
          quick drawing of your teacher sleeping at his desk. A drawing is an
          artwork that's not a painting — it's made of sketched lines and
          represents some object, person, or form.
        </h5>
        <h2>what is sculpture?</h2>
        <h5>
          sculpture, an artistic form in which hard or plastic materials are
          worked into three-dimensional art objects. The designs may be embodied
          in freestanding objects, in reliefs on surfaces, or in environments
          ranging from tableaux to contexts that envelop the spectator.
        </h5>
        <h2>what is installation ?</h2>
        <h5>
          Installation Art is a broad term applied to a range of arts practice
          which involves the installation or configuration of objects in a
          space, where the totality of objects and space comprise the artwork.
          Installation Art is a mode of production and display of artwork rather
          than a movement or style.
        </h5>
        <h2>what is decorative?</h2>
        <h5>
          A decoration is anything used to make something more attractive or
          festive. If you're having a Valentine's Day party, drape your house in
          red and pink decorations. Decoration is also a type of honor, like a
          soldier's medal or stripe.
        </h5>
        <h2>what is painting?</h2>
        <h5>
          Paintings are a form of visual art that captures the expression of
          ideas and emotions on a two-dimensional surface. Artists use the
          elements of shape, colors, line, tones, and textures in unique ways to
          produce paintings that convey sensations of movement, volume, space,
          and light –traditionally on a flat surface.
        </h5>
        <h2>A skill or ability</h2>
        <h5>
          Art can also refer to a skill or ability that someone has learned,
          such as the art of baking a pie or the art of making friends
        </h5>
        <h2>Full form of art is</h2>
        <h5>
          Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Saving Lives, Protecting People
          Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
        </h5>
        <h1>Motivated functions</h1>
        <h5>
          Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on
          the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about
          political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a
          specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to
          illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a
          product, or used as a form of communication.
        </h5>
        <h2>Communication.</h2>
        <h5>
          Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of
          communication have an intent or goal directed toward another
          individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as
          scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are
          another example. However, the content need not be scientific.
          Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.
        </h5>
        <h2>Art as entertainment.</h2>
        <h5>
          Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the
          purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the
          function of the art industries of motion pictures and video games.
        </h5>
        <h2>The Avant-Garde. Art for political change.</h2>
        <h5>
          One of the defining functions of early 20th-century art has been to
          use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that
          had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian constructivism, and
          Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as
          the avant-garde arts.
        </h5>
        <br />
        <h5>
          By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from
          Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be
          hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it
          is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude
          which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting
          plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers
          and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the
          lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. –
          André Breton (Surrealism)
        </h5>
        <h2>Art as a "free zone"</h2>
        <h5>
          removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the avant-garde
          movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to
          produce new universal values, contemporary art has enhanced its
          tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and
          liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion,
          deconstruction, etc.), becoming a more open place for research and
          experimentation.
        </h5>
        <h2>Art for social inquiry,subversion or anarchy.</h2>
        <h5>
          While similar to art for political change, subversive or
          deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without
          any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be
          used to criticize some aspect of society. Graffiti art and other types
          of street art are graphics and images that are spray-painted or
          stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and
          bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as
          graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case
          vandalism).
        </h5>
        <h2>Art for social causes.</h2>
        <h5>
          Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A
          number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of
          autism,[83][84][85] cancer,[86][87][88] human trafficking,[89][90] and
          a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,[91] human
          rights in Darfur,[92] murdered and missing Aboriginal women,[93] elder
          abuse,[94] and pollution.[95] Trashion, using trash to make fashion,
          practiced by artists such as Marina DeBris is one example of using art
          to raise awareness about pollution.
        </h5>
        <h2>Art for psychological and healing purposes.</h2>
        <h5>
          Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical
          psychologists as art therapy. The Diagnostic Drawing Series, for
          example, is used to determine the personality and emotional
          functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in
          this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is
          sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the
          troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable
          approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric
          therapy.
        </h5>
        <h2>Art for propaganda, or commercialism.</h2>
        <h5>
          Art is often used as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to
          subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art
          that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both
          cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into
          a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular
          idea or object.
        </h5>
        <h2>Art as a fitness indicator.</h2>
        <h5>
          It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds
          what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One
          evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain
          and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are
          the human equivalent of the peacock's tail. The purpose of the male
          peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females
          (see also Fisherian runaway and handicap principle). According to this
          theory superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because
          it attracted mates.
        </h5>
        <br />
        <br />The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive,
        as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of
        entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video
        game. Steps
